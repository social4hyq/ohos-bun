/**
 * Regression guard for the 2026-08-18 shim export-list drift: src/linker.lds
 * re-exports ohos-compat-shim's interposed libc symbols (scripts/build/shims/
 * ohos_compat_shim.c) so dlopen'd native modules (.node/.so — @ohos-ports/*
 * packages) resolve them from the executable, matching LD_PRELOAD's
 * global-scope-first semantics (see the comment block in linker.lds and
 * shims.ts's needsOhosCompatShim doc comment).
 *
 * That list is hand-maintained and had silently drifted: the shim grew from
 * 9 to 16 interposed symbols over several commits, but linker.lds's export
 * block was only updated for some of them — `close`, `poll`, `ppoll`,
 * `epoll_ctl`, `epoll_wait`, `epoll_pwait`, and `getaddrinfo` were compiled
 * in and functional for bun's own internal calls (statically bound) but
 * invisible to dlopen'd addons for months before anyone noticed.
 *
 * This test extracts every top-level (non-static) function definition from
 * the vendored shim source — which is exactly the set of interposed libc
 * symbols, one-to-one, verified against `nm -D --defined-only
 * libohos_compat.so` in the canonical ohos-compat-shim repo — and asserts
 * each one is either exported in linker.lds's shim block, or explicitly
 * allowlisted below with a reason. A newly-added interposer that isn't
 * exported AND isn't allowlisted fails this test instead of silently
 * shipping unprotected for dlopen'd addons again.
 *
 * Pure source-text parsing — no compiler, no ninja, runs on every host.
