/**
 * Self-obsoleting workaround registry.
 *
 * Workarounds accumulate as dead code because nobody remembers to remove
 * them once the upstream fix ships. This file is the antidote: every
 * workaround registers an `expectedToBeFixed` predicate that trips once the
 * fix is available, and configure fails with cleanup instructions.
 *
 * Add an entry here whenever you land a workaround that's waiting on an
 * upstream release (LLVM fix, macOS update, Zig release, vendored dep
 * bump, etc.). The entry is the reminder.
 *
 * ## Writing an `expectedToBeFixed` predicate
 *
 * Typically a version check: `cfg.clangVersion >= FIXED_IN_LLVM`,
 * macOS SDK version, a dep's commit hash, etc. When you know exactly
 * which release has the fix, use that. When you don't — fix merged
 * upstream but not released yet — pick your best guess for the likely
 * release. The check might trip on a version that turns out not to
 * have the fix; that's okay. The error message tells the dev to bump
 * the threshold, which takes 30 seconds. That's cheaper than leaving
 * the check blank and the workaround living forever.
 *
 *   - Use `applies` to gate the check to configs where the workaround is
 *     actually exercised — no point failing a Linux build for a
 *     macOS-only workaround.
 *   - Tool/OS detection: if you can't reliably detect (e.g. Apple clang
 *     vs LLVM clang have different version schemes), exclude the
 *     ambiguous case.
